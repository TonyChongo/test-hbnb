# HBnB - Part 01: System Architecture & Documentation (Flask)

This section is part of the second trimester project of Holberton School where students learn to build a full web application with clean architecture using Flask.

## ðŸ“˜ Whatâ€™s Included?

### âœ… Package Diagram
Outlines the three-layer architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: Flask Controllers / Blueprints
- **Business Logic Layer**: Services and Facade
- **Persistence Layer**: DBStorage with SQLAlchemy

### âœ… Class Diagram
Visualizes core models:
- `User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity` inherit from `BaseModel`

Covers critical user flows:
- `POST /register`: Register user
- `POST /places`: Add a place
- `GET /places`: Search/filter places
- `POST /reviews`: Submit a review
